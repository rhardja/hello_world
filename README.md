Hello,
Ray here. I'm new to coding and programming. I was never exposed to programming as of very recently, and found the activity to be enjoyable. This readme is a branch from `readme_edits`. 

In the next steps of this tutorial, I will be creating a pull request. Once the pull request is accepted, the branch `readme_edits` will be deleted.
